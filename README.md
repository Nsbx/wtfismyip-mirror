# Dual-stack hostname endpoints

*wtfismyip.com is dual-stack. Operating system defaults and network connectivity will determine whether you get an IPv4 or IPv6 address. That can be really fucking annoying, so we also have IPv4/IPv6-only endpoints as documented below.*

- `https://json.myip.wtf`
- `https://xml.myip.wtf`
- `https://text.wtfismyip.com/`
